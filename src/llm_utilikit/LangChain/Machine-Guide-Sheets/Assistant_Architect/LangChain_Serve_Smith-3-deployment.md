# LangChain/Serve/Smith Deployment

## LangServe Deployment and Querying with GPT-3.5-Turbo

- Deploying and querying the GPT-3.5-Turbo model using LangServe.
  
- Illustrates using LangServe for server-side model management and deployment.

```python
from langserve import LangServeClient  

# Initialize the LangServe client   
langserve_client = LangServeClient(api_url="https://api.langserve.com")  

# Deploying the GPT-3.5-Turbo model  
model_config = {
    "model_name": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
    "description": "GPT-3.5 Turbo model for general-purpose use"   
}
deployment_response = langserve_client.deploy_model(model_config)
print("Deployment Status:", deployment_response.status)  

# Sending a query to the deployed model  
query = "Explain the concept of machine learning in simple terms."
response = langserve_client.query_model(model_name="gpt-3.5-turbo", query=query)
print("Model Response:", response.content)
```

## LangSmith Tracing for Enhanced Monitoring

- Showcasing LangSmith tracing within LangServe for detailed monitoring.
  
- Key concepts: interaction tracing, performance analysis

```python
from langserve import LangServeClient 
from langsmith import Tracing   

# Initialize LangServe client and enable LangSmith tracing  
langserve_client = LangServeClient(api_url="https://api.langserve.com")
Tracing.enable()    

# Deploying a model with tracing enabled   
model_config = {
    "model_name": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
    "description": "GPT-3.5 Turbo model with LangSmith tracing" 
}
langserve_client.deploy_model(model_config)  

# Query with tracing for detailed interaction logs  
query = "Explain the impact of AI on environmental sustainability."
response = langserve_client.query_model(model_name="gpt-3.5-turbo", query=query)
print("Traced Model Response:", response.content)  

# Retrieve and analyze trace logs
trace_logs = Tracing.get_logs()
print("Trace Logs:", trace_logs)
```

- This shows integrating LangSmith tracing in LangServe for monitoring and analyzing model interactions.

## Conclusion

LangServe and LangSmith provide robust deployment and monitoring capabilities to complement LangChain's foundations.
