1. Create a new file named `openai_chat.py` and move the `OpenAI_Chat` class into it. Also, move the necessary imports to this file:

```python
# openai_chat.py

import openai
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os

load_dotenv()

class OpenAI_Chat:
    # ... (rest of the class remains unchanged)
```

2. Create another new file named `chat_application.py` and move the `ChatApplication` class into it. Also, move the necessary imports to this file:

```python
# chat_application.py

import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import scrolledtext, messagebox, ttk
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
import logging

class ChatApplication(tk.Tk):
    # ... (rest of the class remains unchanged)
```

3. In the main file, import the `OpenAI_Chat` and `ChatApplication` classes and remove the class definitions:

```python
# main.py

import os
import logging
import panel as pn
from dotenv import load_dotenv, find_dotenv
from openai_chat import OpenAI_Chat
from chat_application import ChatApplication

# ... (rest of the code remains unchanged, except for the removed class definitions)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # ... (rest of the code remains unchanged)
