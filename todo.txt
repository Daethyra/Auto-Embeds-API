- Clean all of my Jupyter notebook Gists to create an agent 
  - With production-grade code stored locally, it may be useful \
  as a codebase for LLM agents.
  - By supplying enough production-grade code that can be repurposed \
  for our intended use case, we can steer our Generator towards \
  desirable outcomes.
  - [Objective] : "Build a knowledgebase for leverage in programming \
  production-grade code, specifically related to the creation of more \
  machine learning code, much like it."
  - [Thoughts] : "By creating a codebase of repurposable Python modules, \
  we can use LangChain to query the top_k results for functions to serve \
  contextual needs."
