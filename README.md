# LLM Utilikit

The Utilikit is a Python library designed to enhance large-language-model projects. It offers a variety of components, prompts, and templates, and is open for contributions from users. The library aims to provide a quick start for new projects and modular, reusable components for existing ones. 

This repository has a split purpose but a sole focus.
* The first is supporting users with prompts:
  * The Utilikit features two main types of prompts: [multi-shot](./prompts_MASTER.md#Multi-Shot-Prompts) and [user-role](./prompts_MASTER.md#User-Role-Prompts), detailed in the [prompts_MASTER.md](./prompts_MASTER.md) file. Additionally, a [prompt-cheatsheet](./prompt-cheatsheet.md) is available for reference.
* The second is providing prebuilt Python modules to help you jumpstart or augment LLM related projects.
  * It supports libraries like OpenAI, LangChain, HuggingFace, and Pinecone.
