# OpenAI Utility Toolkit (OUT)
## Welcome to the OpenAI Utility Toolkit (OUT) 
Your one-stop destination for enhancing your interaction with OpenAI models. Originally, this repository housed a single module, but I've now expanded it to include a multitude of utilities that offer additional functionality and ease-of-use.

# Contents
[BlindProgamming](https://github.com/Daethyra/OUT/tree/master/BlindProgamming)
The BlindProgamming folder contains text files designed to inspire/augment users' solve their code's problems with the assistance of OpenAI's GPT models. 
There's currently only one file for programmers, and there are plans to add more format-oriented prompts.

[AutoEmbedder](https://github.com/Daethyra/OUT/tree/master/GPT%20Auto-embed%20Messages)
The OpenAI-Pinecone module is a Python script that integrates the OpenAI models with Pinecone's vector database. 
This utility requires integration with other modules to function, as it is a back-end processor that requests embeddings for the user's input from OpenAI and then sends them over a Pinecone index.

[GPT-Chatbot](https://github.com/Daethyra/OUT/tree/master/gpt-chatbot)
This is a standalone module that creates a GUI interface which provides functionality to send 'system' messages, reset the conversation, and automatically store the last 10 responses from the GPT model

# Future Plans

As the author of this toolkit, I'm thrilled with the progress I've made so far, but there's so much more to come! My intention is to continue adding more back-end modules that interact with OpenAI's models and provide additional functionality for developers. 

I'm *always* open to suggestions and contributions, so don't hesitate to reach out if you've got an idea or a tool that could be a valuable addition to the OpenAI Utility Toolkit.
