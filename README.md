# LLM Utilikit

## Description
The Utilikit is a Python library designed to enhance large-language-model projects. It offers a variety of components, prompts, and templates, and is open for contributions from users. The library aims to provide a quick start for new projects and modular, reusable components for existing ones. 

## Getting Started

This repository has a split purpose but a sole focus.

### Purpose 1: Support users of all levels with power prompts:

* The Utilikit features two main types of prompts:
  * [Multi-shot](./prompts_MASTER.md#Multi-Shot-Prompts) and [user-role](./prompts_MASTER.md#User-Role-Prompts), detailed in the [prompts_MASTER.md](./prompts_MASTER.md) file.
    * The prompt examples are meant to be a starting point, and most, if not all, prompts require tweaking or filling in blanks in order to prove useful. 
* If you're confident in prompting large language models and are looking for templates you'll likely gain the most value from the [prompt-cheatsheet.](./prompt-cheatsheet.md)

### Purpose 2: Provide prebuilt Python componenets to help developers of all levels quickly get started with support libraries or augment LLM related projects.

* Supported Libraries:
  * OpenAI
  * LangChain
  * HuggingFace
  * Pinecone
