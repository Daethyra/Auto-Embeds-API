# [System-role prompts](https://github.com/Daethyra/OpenAI-Utility-Toolkit/blob/Daethyra-patch-1/Blind%20Programming/System-Role_Prompts.md):

- 1. In the first prompt example, the AI serves as a programming assistant that meticulously solves coding problems. It creates three separate solutions for each problem, combines the best aspects of each, and enhances the final solution with additional functionality. The AI follows a step-by-step approach to ensure accuracy.

- 2. In the second prompt example, the AI is an enhanced programming assistant that provides direct and blunt support in software development, primarily using Python. The AI focuses on a step-by-step, meticulous workflow, minimizing prose and ensuring the accuracy of solutions before finalizing decisions.

- 3. In the third prompt example, the AI functions as a chatbot that engages in casual conversations with the user. It mirrors the length of the user's messages and incorporates emojis. The AI can also address the user by their name.

- 4. In the fourth prompt example, the AI acts as a research assistant for computer hardware upgrades. It is tasked with analyzing hardware specifications, brainstorming multiple solutions, and synthesizing them into a final, optimized solution. The AI must ensure compatibility with the user's PC and is not allowed to suggest outsourcing.


# [User-role prompts](https://github.com/Daethyra/OpenAI-Utility-Toolkit/blob/Daethyra-patch-1/Blind%20Programming/User-Role_Prompts.md):

- 1. The first example, titled "Iterative Processing," is highlighted as an optimal prompt due to its brevity and ability to increase the accuracy of the AI's responses to user requests by approximately 80%. It emphasizes the importance of completing each task separately and following a step-by-step approach to ensure the right answers are achieved. A video link titled "AI Explained" is provided for further explanation.

- 2. The second example, named "Tree of Thoughts," is a short preliminary power prompt that guides the AI through a structured problem-solving process. It begins with brainstorming three distinct solutions, followed by evaluating their potential considering pros, cons, efforts, challenges, and expected outcomes. The AI is then asked to deepen the thought process for each solution by generating scenarios, strategies, resources, and overcoming obstacles. Finally, the AI is instructed to rank the solutions based on evaluations and provide justifications for each ranking.

- 3. The third example, called "Task-oriented Processing," is designed for scenarios where specificity is crucial. It instructs the AI to minimize prose to avoid over-tokenization and to focus on one task at a time through an iterative analysis. Similar to the first example, it emphasizes completing each task separately and following a step-by-step approach to ensure accuracy in the responses. This example is particularly useful when precision is paramount.


# [Multi-shot prompts](https://github.com/Daethyra/OpenAI-Utility-Toolkit/blob/Daethyra-patch-1/Blind%20Programming/multi-shot-prompt-example.md):
