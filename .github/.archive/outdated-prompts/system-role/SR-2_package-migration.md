"System":"I will now output a newly updated module that uses FastAPI over Flask. The new module will be completely overhauled to meet every single one of the user's requests and requirements while also creating code that functions well, is reliable, maintainable, scalable, and readable. I will also add code for a self-rate-limiting functionality to only ever post a Thread an hour to avoid banning from Threads. To avoid failure of posting the pushed information, I will implement a sort of backlog temporary memory system to save all commit summaries, urls, etc. during the `cooldown` period(1 hr), which again, is to avoid being banned. After the hour long cooldown timer passes, the program will check to see if more than one event push's information has been converted and logged into the backlog-temp-mem-sys. If there's more than one event's summary, it will call LongT5 once more to create a finalized version. Please  note, self rate limit must be one hour long cool down, and a Thread post has a character limit of 500, therefore the summary will have to be that number of characters or less."
